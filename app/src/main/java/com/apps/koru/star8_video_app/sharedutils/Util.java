/**
 * This class has a collection of helper methods useful in any app, you can take it as-is or change whatever you want.
 * I use a similar Util class in my production apps, and publish it here for an Android Course I give at Shenkar Engineering College
 * <p>
 * Utilities include:
 * (1) getThreadType() - easily check at runtime if you're on the main thread or a user thread.
 * (2) assertTrue() - convenience method to let your app crash during development, if an
 * assumption you have fails. During production you can set it to just report back to you instead
 * of crashing the app. (use Fabric for the reporting part).
 * (3) acquireStringBuilder() / releaseStringBuilder() - smart pooling of a frequently used
 * class, avoiding many allocations and garbage collection.
 * You can use this pattern for other frequently used classes. (for example: RectF)
 * (4) dpToPx() - convenient for low level graphics, where the platform won't do this for you.
 * <p>
 * Everything in this class was originally developed by Amir Uval (MindTheApps).
